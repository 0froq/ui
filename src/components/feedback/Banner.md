Banner is a full-width notice placed above a site's header or content, unlike an inline Alert. It stays in normal document flow and wraps naturally; fixed or sticky positioning is caller-owned. It has no timer, storage, routing or `v-model`.

The required `label` names a region. This is not the `banner` landmark reserved for the site's header, and it is not an automatic live announcement. Important static notices remain available without repeatedly interrupting assistive technology.

Providing `dismissLabel` adds a button that emits `dismiss`. The caller owns visibility, persistence and focus after removal. Do not make required information available only in a dismissible notice. The `actions` slot accepts genuine links or buttons; do not make the whole notice clickable.

Import `@froq/ui/style.css` and place it inside `.ui`. Copy, links, translations and campaign policy stay outside the library.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Banner } from '@froq/ui'
import '@froq/ui/style.css'
</script>

<template>
  <div class="ui">
    <Banner label="Site notice">
      This site is a work in progress.
      <template #actions>
        <a href="/changelog">See what's changing</a>
      </template>
    </Banner>
  </div>
</template>
```
