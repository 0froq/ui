Popover is a non-modal, trigger-anchored panel. The trigger slot must resolve to one real button; a button component used there must forward the attributes and listeners passed by the primitive. The default slot receives `{ close }`. Calling `close()` or pressing Escape or interacting outside closes the panel. Closing unmounts its content.

The panel prefers `side` and `align`, then automatically adjusts to avoid viewport collisions with 12 pixels of collision padding. `disabled` applies only to the trigger. Undeclared attributes are forwarded to the content panel, not the trigger. The component root does not add the `.ui` class.

By default, content is teleported into the closest consumer element with `class="ui"`; if there is none, it renders inline. On the server, only the trigger is rendered; portal content appears after opening on the client. A custom `portalTo` target must already exist and provide the consumer's theme and UI tokens. The library does not add Reka UI CSS variables to its token contract.

Popover is not a menu, tooltip, or modal dialog. Keep complex content and its business behavior in the consuming application. Import `style.css` in the caller and provide a `.ui` ancestor for the library styles and default portal target.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Button, Popover } from '@froq/ui'
import { ref } from 'vue'
import '@froq/ui/style.css'

const open = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="ui">
    <Popover
      v-model="open"
      label="Publication status"
      close-label="Close status"
    >
      <template #trigger>
        <Button>Publication status</Button>
      </template>
      <template #default="{ close }">
        <p>This document is still a draft.</p>
        <Button @click="close">
          Understood
        </Button>
      </template>
    </Popover>
  </div>
</template>
```
